## Basic terminology
**File system:** the way files are stored and organized.
**Current directory:** the directory where you are at the moment.
**parent directory:** always working inside a particular directory and can move forward to a subdirectory or backwards to the previous directory.
**the difference between YOUR HOME directory and THE HOME directory:** terminal emulator is where you are currently working and thats in your home directory. The home directory however, is when you open file manager.
**pathname:** indicates location of the file in the filesystem.
**relative path:** locations of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is loacted inside the current working directory.
**absolute path:** locations of a file starting at the root of the file system
